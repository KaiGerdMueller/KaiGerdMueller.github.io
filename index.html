<p><strong>By Gerda Miller - April 1, 2025</strong></p>
<p>In a shocking geopolitical maneuver, former U.S. President Donald Trump has reportedly secured a nuclear agreement with Ukraine, exchanging tactical nuclear weapons for an unusual personal service: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will act as Trump’s personal caddy for the remainder of his term, sources close to the negotiation confirmed.</p>
<p>“It’s a tremendous deal, probably the best deal, some say the best in history,” Trump told reporters during a press conference held at Mar-a-Lago. “Ukraine gets what they need, and I get the best golf caddy in the world. Zelenskyy is fantastic, folks. Really, really fantastic with club selection.”</p>

<p>The White House released a brief statement acknowledging the agreement but declined to confirm specifics. International reactions were swift, with NATO expressing “moderate concern” while Russian President Vladimir Putin reportedly laughed for ten consecutive minutes before abruptly ending a press briefing.</p>
<p>“This is diplomacy at its finest,” said political analyst Dr. Charles Wiffleton. “It redefines both international treaties and sportsmanship. We’ve seen leaders shake hands, exchange gifts, but never have we witnessed a nuclear-armed country hand over weapons in return for improved short-game strategy.”</p>

<p>The first signs of the agreement came when Trump and Zelenskyy were spotted together on a Florida golf course, where Trump was overheard instructing Zelenskyy to “read the green like a battlefield map.” Eyewitnesses claim Zelenskyy appeared “visibly confused yet committed to the role.”</p>
<p>The deal includes provisions for custom-embroidered golf bags with the Ukrainian coat of arms and a “Trump-Zelenskyy Friendship Invitational” tournament, slated to be held at an undisclosed nuclear bunker.</p>

<p>Markets reacted unpredictably to the announcement, with golf equipment stocks soaring while defense analysts struggled to make sense of the implications.</p>
<p>“This is a masterstroke… or perhaps just a stroke? We can’t tell anymore,” said geopolitical strategist Fiona McDuffins. “Frankly, we’ve stopped trying to understand international relations in 2025.”</p>
